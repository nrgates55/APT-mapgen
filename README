Overview:
The program generates a ©Pokémon styled map.

the map includes:
    Border of % with one exit per side (NESW)
    Two intersecting paths #
    2 tall grass regions :, clearing regions ., and 1 or more water regions ~
    A 2x2 PC and 2x2 PM 

to run with a fixed seed:
./mapgen <seed>

Program design at a high level:
    1. initialize the map array
    2. create the boarder
    3. fill the interior
    4. paint terrain blobs
    5. carve paths
    6. place the buildings
    7. print the map

Important functions:

    void paint_blob(char terrain, int steps)
        creats a region of terrain by doing a random walk

    void carve_path(Point start, Point goal)
        carves a path of # from start to goal using a randomized directed walk

    void place_building_near_road(char b)
        randomly picks a road tile, checks positions for a 2x2 spot, clears the cells in a ring, and places the building
